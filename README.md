Final   Exam 
December   9,   2024 
Instructions: 
You   have   six   hours   to   work   on   this   exam.    It   is   worth   100   points,   contributing   to   your   overall score for the course as described in the   Syllabus.   You may   consult   all   course   materials   and   standard   Internet   resources   while   working   on   the   exam,   but   your   work   must   be   original   and   you   may   not   solicitor obtain assistance from or provide   assistance   to   other   people   for   any   part   of the   exam   (this   includes   obtaining   help   from   artificial   intelligence).   Activities   considered   cheating   include   copying   or   closely   paraphrasing   content   from   websites,    discussing    exam    questions    with    other    students,   and/or   using   ChatGPT   or   similar   tools.       All    exams    will   be   checked   for   originality   and   copied   content,   and   anyone   found   cheating will   be   assigned   a   zero   score   for the   exam.      Read   carefully   each   part   of each   question   before   you jump   into   working   on   it   and   do   not   panic   if you   cannot   complete   everything.    The   exam   is   also   intended   to   stretch   your   knowledge   by   forcing   you   to   use   the   tools and   information   you   have   acquired.    I   want   to   see   how   you   think   about   issues   based   on   what   you   learned.   If there is   a question you cannot   answer,   do   not   get   bogged   down   and   move   on to   the   next   question.   Write   legibly.
Problem   1:   International   Monetary   Policy   Cooperation   after   a   Crisis   (50   Points) 
We   can   use   a   slightly   modified version   of the   model you   analyzed   in   Homework   4 to   study   interna-   tional   monetary   policy   cooperation   in   response   to   a   Önancial   crisis.
Suppose   we   modify   the   money   demand   equations   for   the   Home   and   Foreign   countries   in   the   model   by   introducing   money   velocities   v   and   v*    as   follows:m +   v         =       p +   y;                                                                                                                                                                                       (1)m*   +   v*               =         p*   +   y*   :                                                                                                                                                                              (2)
Velocity   is   the   rate   at   which   agents   in   each   country   dispose   of   money   for   transactions.    For   given   money   supply,   higher   velocity   translates   into   higher   prices   and/or   output.
The   introduction   of   velocities   v   and   v*    is   the   only   change   we   make   to   the   Homework   4   model.   Hence,   refer   to   Homework   4,   pages   1   and   2,   for   the   description   of the   rest   of the   model.
Assume that velocity in each country   is   an   independently   and   identically   distributed   exogenous   shock   with   average   value   of   zero, like   the   exogenous   productivity   shock   x   in   the   production   function   (as   for   other   variables,    v    and    v*       measure    the   percent   deviations   of   Home    and   Foreign   money   velocity   from   the   zero-shock   equilibrium).      We   take   velocity   as   the   indicator   of   the   situation   of   credit   markets:   A   credit   market   collapse   results   in   a   drop   in velocity   (negative realizations of both   v   and   v*    in   aglobal   credit   crisis) as   agents   have   an   incentive   to   hold   on   to   liquidity   and   the   number of   transactions   in   the   economy   drops.As   in   Homework   4, assume   that   Home   wage   setters   chose   wat   time   -1 to   minimize   E-1    (n2   )=2,   and   similarly   in   Foreign.   Also   continue   to   assume   that   the   central   bank   in   each   country   wants   to stabilize   CPI   and   employment   at   their   zero-shock   levels,   and   it   minimizes   the   same   loss   function   as   in   Homework   4   (bottom   of   page   3).
●   Show   that   the   following   results   hold   in   our   extended   model   with   velocity   shocks   (it   is   enough   to   show   this   for   one   country,   say,   Home):
w         =       E-1   (m +   v) = 0;
w*               =       E-1   (m*   +   v*   ) = 0;
n         =       m +   v;
n*               =         m*   +   v*   ;
y         =         (1 -   α) (m   +   v) -   x;
y*               =       (1 -   α)   (m*   +   v*   ) -   x
p         =       α (m +   v) +   x;
p*               =       α (m*   +   v*   ) +   x:Note   that   there   are   two   ways   to   show   this:   one   is   by   using    ''brute   force'' and   doing   the   algebra,   the   other   is   by   being   smart,   thinking   carefully   about   the   one   change   we   made   relative   to   the   Homework   4   model,   and   what   it   should   imply   for   these   equations   and   those   in   the   next   bullet   relative   to   results   in   Homework   4.      Feel   free   to   use   the   smart   strategy   if you figure   it   out,   but   explain   it   clearly.
Note:   A   credit   crisis   (a   drop   in   velocity)   puts   downward   pressure   on   employment,   output,   and   prices.
●   Show   (by   doing   the   algebra   or   by   being   smart)   that   the   nominal   exchange   rate   and   the   terms   of trade   are   determined   by:

and   Home   and   Foreign   CPIs   are:
●   Assume equal country size (a = 1=2) and show that the Örst-order condition for the
optimal choice of   money supply by the Home central bank under non-cooperation   is:

and   that   it   can   be   rewritten   as:
Define   the   following   coefficients:

Then,   we   can   rewrite   equation   (3)   as:

or:
●   Explain the signs of the Home central   bankís   responses   to   Foreign   money   supply,   Foreign money velocity, Home money velocity, and the   productivity   shock.    Note:   Explain   does   not   mean      ìstate   in   words.î   It   means   explain   why   the   sign   is   what   it   is.
●   Show   (by brute force or by being smart, but explaining it) that the foreign central   bankís   behavior   is   determined   by   the   reaction   function:
●   Show   that   the   Nash   equilibrium   level   of Home   money   supply   is:

If you   use   the   expressions   for   H1(N)      and   H2(N),   you   can   verify   that:

Take   this   for   granted.   I   am   not   asking   you   to   prove   it.
Taking   the   expression   for   H3(N)      into   account,   it   follows   that:
●   Show   (by brute force or by being smart, but explain it) that the Nash equilibrium   level   of Foreign   money   supply   is:
●   What is the intuition for   how   the   central   banks   respond   to   velocity   shocks   in   the   Nash   equilibrium?
●   If x = 0, what are the Nash   equilibrium   values   of   the   central   banksíloss   functions   LCB    and   LCB* ?
●   What   is   the   intuition   for   these   values?
●   Show   that   the first-order      condition      for   the   optimal      choice   of      m   when   the   two   central   banks      coordinate   their   policies      (i.e.,   jointly      minimize   a      combination   of the   loss   functions   with   weights   equal   to   1/2)   is:

Proceeding   as   in   the   non-cooperative   case,   we   can   rewrite   equation   (8)   as:   
where   we   define:

●   Show   (by   using   brute   force   or   by   being   smart,   but   explaining   it)   that   the   Örst-   order   condition   for   the   cooperative   choice   of   m*    yields:
●   Show   (by using brute force or by being smart, but   explaining   it)   that   the   solution   for   Home   money   supply   under   cooperation   (mC   )   is:
Using   the   expressions   for   H1(C)   and   H2(C)   shows   that   H1(C)   - H2(C)   =   1 - √ (1 - α2   ).    Hence,   taking
H3(C)      = √ α into   account,   we   have:

●   Show   (by using brute force or by being smart, but   explaining   it)   that   the   solution   for   Foreign   money   supply   under   cooperation   (m*C)   is::

●   Why   do   the   central   banks   respond   to   velocity   shocks   in   the   same   way   as   they   did   in   the   Nash   equilibrium?
●   If x   = 0,   is   there   anything   to   be   gained   from   international   monetary   cooperation   in   response   to   the   velocity   shocks   U   and   U*   ?      Why?However,   the   responses   to   the   productivity   shock   x   differ   between   Nash   and   cooperative   equi-   libria.       In    particular,   we   can   verify   that   the   cooperative   responses   are   less   aggressive   than   the   non-cooperative   ones   (I   am   not   asking   you   to   verify   it).
●   What   explains   the   reduction   in   policy   aggressiveness   when   central   banks   coop-   erate   in   responding   to   x?Now   remember   what   we   learned   from   Ben   Bernankeís   article   on   the   Great   Depression:   Credit   market   crises   have   negative   supply-side   e§ects   as   asymmetric   information   issues   make   access   to   credit   harder   and   prevent   Örms   from   operating   e¢   ciently.    In   our   model,   we   can   capture   this   by positing   that   the   shock   x,   instead   of   being   purely   independent   from   U   and   U*   ,   depends   on   these   variables:    x   = x (U,   U*).In   particular,   suppose   that,   when   U   and   U*    become   negative   (a   global   credit   crisis),   儿   becomes   positive   (a   productivity   loss).      Suppose   that   parameter   values   are   such   that   the   overall   response   of   monetary   policy   to   the   combination   of   velocity      and   productivity   shocks   in   each   country   is   expansionary   in   both   the   Nash   equilibrium   and   the   cooperative   one.
●   How   does   the   response   to   the   combined   shocks   in   the   cooperative   equilibrium   di§er   from   that   in   the   Nash   equilibrium   (is   it   more   or   less   expansionary)?
●   Why?Bottom   line:   Using   a   small   extension   to   the   Homework   4   problem   and   remembering   what   we learned from Ben Bernanke o§ers a possible   explanation   for   why   central   banks   may   find   it   desirable   to   coordinate   their   responses   to   global   credit   crises.
Problem   2:   A   Simple   Theory   of Exchange   Rate   Random Walks   (30   points)Richard   Meese   and   Kenneth   Rogo§   argued   in   a   1983   Journal   of   International   Economics   paper that   the   exchange   rate   models   written   in   the   1970s   (like   Rudiger   Dornbuschísovershooting   model)   could   not predict the future exchange   rate   better   than   a   random   walk,   i.e.,   better   than just   taking   the   current   exchange   rate   as   our   best   forecast   of the   future   exchange   rate.   This   result was   a   major   stumbling   bloc   for   exchange   rate   theories   for   decades   because   it   was   viewed   as   inconsistent   with   theory.    This   problem   asks   you   to   explore   a   simple   theoretical   model   that   generates   random   walk behavior   of the   exchange   rate.
Consider   two   countries,   Home   and   Foreign,   and   suppose   uncovered   interest   rate   parity   (UIP)   holds,   so   that:
it   -   it(*)   =   Et("t+1)   -   "t   ;where   it      and   it(*)   are   the   Home   and   Foreign   nominal   interest   rates,   "t      is   the   exchange   rate   (units   ofHome   currency   per   unity   of   Foreign), and   Et      is   the   expectation   operator   conditional   on   information   available   at   time   t.
Assume   that   the   Home   and   Foreign   central   banks   set   their   interest   rates   in   response   to   CPI   ináation   according   to   the   policy   rules:
it   = Tπt   + ξt
and:
it(*)   = Tπt(*)   + ξt(*)   ;
with   T   >   1, where πt      and πt(*)   are   the   Home   and   Foreign   CPI   ináation   rates,   and   ξt      and   ξt(*)   are   iden-
tically   and   independently   distributed   random   shocks   such   that   Et(ξt+1) = Et(ξt(*)+1) = 0.    Ináation
rates   are   deÖned   by πt 三 pt   -pt-1    and πt(*) 三 pt(*)   -pt(*)-1   , where   pt      and   pt(*)   are   the   Home   and   Foreign
CPIs.
Assume   also   that   purchasing   power   parity   (PPP)   holds,   so   that:
pt   -   pt(*)   =   "t:
●   Use   the   policy   rules   of the   central   banks,   the   definitions   of   ináation   rates,   and   PPP   to   show   that   policy   behavior   by   the   central   banks   implies:
it — it(*)   = T("t — "t-1   )   + ξt — ξt(*):
●   Combine   this   equation   with   the   UIP   condition   to   show   that   the   exchange   rate   satisÖes   the   equation:Et("t+1) — "t   = T("t — "t-1   ) + ξt — ξt(*):                                                                                                                  (11)
Trust   me   on   the   following   statement:   Given   the   assumption   T   >   1,   this   equation   has   a   unique solution   for   the   exchange   rate   in   every   period   t   that   has   the   form.	"t   = "t-1   + η (ξt — ξt(*)) ;                                                                                                                                                                     (12)
where   η   is   a   parameter   (to   be   determined)   that   measures   the   responsiveness   of the   exchange   rate   to   the   di§erence   between   exogenous   Home   and   Foreign   interest   rate   shocks.
●   What   do   this   form   of the   solution   for   the   exchange   rate   and   the   assumptions   we   made   above   imply   for   Et("t+1)?
For   (12)   to   be   the   solution   for   "t,   we   must   find   the   value   of   η   such   that,   if   we   substitute   (12)   into   (11)   for   "t,   we   obtain   0 = 0.
●   Substitute   (12) into   (11) for "t, use the result you   obtained   in the   previous   bullet,   and   show   that   it   must   be:

This   result   implies   that   the   solution   for   the   exchange   rate   in   the   model   of this   problem   is:

●   Is      this      solution      consistent      with      your      intuition      for      what      should      happen      to      the   exchange      rate      if   a      central      bank      imparted      a      contractionary      shock      to      monetary   policy?   Brie'y   explain   your   answer.
●   Is   the   solution   for   the   exchange   rate   consistent   with   Meese   and   Rogoff's   finding   mentioned   at   the   beginning   of this   problem?
